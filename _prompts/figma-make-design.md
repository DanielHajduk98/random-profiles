### I've been using it as an inspiration for the design but later I've decided to also use figma make to generate prompts for creating layouts.

# User (Prompt generated by chatgpt)

Design a dark-themed profiles gallery page for a web app.

Page background:
- Linear gradient
- Bottom-left: black
- Gradually transitions to dark purple

Layout:
- Centered content container
- Header at the top with space reserved for a future search bar
- Below the header, a grid of profile cards

Grid behavior:
- Desktop: 4 cards per row
- Mobile: 1 card per row
- Even spacing between cards

Profile card design:
- Dark surface with subtle contrast from background
- Slightly rounded corners
- Soft shadow or glow
- On hover:
  - Card slightly scales up
  - Purple highlight or glow appears

Card content (top to bottom):
- Circular avatar image
- Full name (prominent)
- Short bio text (muted, secondary)

Overall style:
- Modern
- Clean
- Minimal
- Purple-accented
- Feels like a real product, not a demo

Avoid clutter and excessive decoration.

#Figma make

I'll create a modern, dark-themed profiles gallery page with a gradient background and smooth hover effects. Let me start by gathering some profile images and then build out the components.

I've created a modern, dark-themed profiles gallery page with a smooth gradient from black to dark purple. The page features a responsive grid that displays 4 cards per row on desktop and stacks to 1 card on mobile, with each card having a subtle hover effect that scales up and adds a purple glow for a polished, product-ready feel.

---
# User
Add a profile page

---
# figma make
I've added individual profile pages with full routing functionality. Now clicking on any profile card navigates to a dedicated profile page showing detailed information including their role, location, email, an expanded bio, and their skills. The pages maintain the same dark purple gradient aesthetic with smooth navigation between the gallery and individual profiles.

---
# user

each profile in the details page should have the following information displayed:
* name
* email
* age
* job title
* company
* phone
* address
* bio
---
Describe the created design in a prompt for cursor.

---
# figma-make

Perfect! I've updated the profile pages with all the requested information. Now let me create a detailed prompt description for Cursor:
Design Prompt for Cursor

    Centered content (max-width: 4xl)
    Back button with left arrow icon and hover animation
    Profile header card with:
        Larger circular avatar (w-32 h-32) with purple ring
        Name as large heading
        Bio in purple accent color
        Two-column grid (responsive) displaying:
            Left column: Job title, Company, Email, Phone
            Right column: Age, Location, Address
        Each field has:
            Small label in muted gray (text-xs text-zinc-500)
            Value in white text
            Corresponding Lucide icon

    No clutter or excessive decoration

Responsive Behavior:

    Grid adapts from 4 → 2 → 1 columns
    Profile detail switches from 2-column to stacked layout on mobile
    Maintains readability and spacing at all breakpoints

I've updated all profile detail pages to display the complete information including name, email, age, job title, company, phone, address, and bio in a clean two-column layout with labeled fields and icons.

---
# User

remove the about and skills sections. Instead create job section, location section and contact sections below a heading section with name, avatar and bio

---
# Figma-make

I've reorganized the profile detail page into four clear sections: a centered heading section with avatar, name, and bio, followed by separate Job, Location, and Contact sections, each with their own icon and organized information cards.

---
# user
fill the space on job, location and contact page better.

---
# figma-make

I've reorganized the Job, Location, and Contact sections into a three-column grid layout on desktop (and stacking vertically on mobile), making much better use of the horizontal space. Each section now has more breathing room with increased spacing between fields.

---
# user
move the age to the first section with avatar

---
# figma-make
I've moved the age to the heading section, displaying it right below the name and above the bio. The Job section now only contains Job Title and Company, creating a more balanced layout across all three information cards.

---
# user
use only the following information for a profile
* name
* email
* age
* job title
* company
* phone
* address
* bio

---
# figma-make
I've updated the profile structure to use only the specified fields: name, email, age, job title, company, phone, address, and bio. The Profile interface and all data have been simplified, and the ProfilePage now correctly references profile.jobTitle instead of profile.role. The layout remains clean with the three-column grid for Job, Address, and Contact sections.

---
# user
i don't like that the address is having so much empty space. Suggest different layout which uses all mentioned information and still looks interesting to the user

---
# figma-make
I've redesigned the profile page with a more balanced layout. The new structure features three full-width cards: the header with avatar/name/age/bio remains centered, followed by a "Professional" section displaying job title and company in a two-column grid, and finally a "Contact Information" section that groups email and phone on the left with address on the right. This eliminates the awkward empty space and creates a cleaner visual hierarchy with better content distribution across all sections.

---
#user
represent this layout in a detailed CSS grid like structure would be understandable by AI.

- Cards: bg-zinc-900/50 with backdrop-blur-sm
- Text: white (primary), zinc-500 (labels), purple-400 (accents)
- Icons: purple-400

SPACING:
- Section gaps: mb-6 between cards
- Internal padding: p-8 on all cards
- Grid gaps: gap-6 (professional), gap-8 (contact)
- Vertical spacing: space-y-6 for stacked items

# user

we should reprezent the age in a different way than in the middle of the profile section, it looks out of place

---
# figma make

I've moved the age to the Professional section, which now displays three fields in a balanced grid: Job Title, Company, and Age. This feels much more natural than having it interrupt the header section, and it creates better visual balance across the profile page.

---
# user
I want separate catalogue page which displays 20 profiles and a search page which limits the profiles to 10. How can i differentiate those pages? Are they any features that first page should have?

---
# figma-make
Great question! Here's how you can differentiate these two pages:
Catalogue Page (20 profiles) - Browse & Discover

Primary Features:

    Featured/highlighted profiles at the top (2-4 profiles with larger cards or special styling)
    Category filters (by role, location, company) as pills/tabs below header
    Sort options (newest, alphabetical, by age, by company)
    View toggle (grid vs. compact list view)
    "All Profiles" header with total count badge (e.g., "All Profiles · 20")
    Pagination or infinite scroll if catalogue grows beyond 20
    No search bar - keeps it clean and browse-focused

Visual Identity:

    Larger, more spacious cards (current 4-column grid works well)
    Rich visuals, emphasis on avatars and imagery
    "Explore" or "Browse" language
    Could have hero section or categories

Search Page (10 profiles) - Find & Filter

Primary Features:

    Prominent search input with real-time filtering
    Search results count ("10 results for 'designer'" or "Showing 10 of 20")
    Advanced filters sidebar (age range, job title, location, company)
    Compact list/card view (maybe 2 columns instead of 4, or even list layout)
    Matched text highlighting in name/bio/job title
    Sort by relevance (plus name, age, etc.)
    Empty state ("No profiles match your search")
    Recent searches or suggestions

Visual Identity:

    Denser, more compact cards showing more info at a glance
    Could show job title + company in card (not just name + bio)
    "Search & Filter" or "Find Profiles" header
    Functional, tool-like aesthetic

Key Differentiators:
Aspect	Catalogue	Search
Purpose	Discovery, browsing	Finding specific people
Layout	Spacious grid (4 cols)	Compact grid/list (2 cols)
Card size	Larger, image-focused	Smaller, info-dense
Filters	Categories, broad sorting	Specific filters, search
Header	Clean, minimal	Search bar prominent
Count	"All Profiles · 20"	"10 results found"
Navigation	Root path / or /browse	/search
Routing Suggestion:

/              → Catalogue (20 profiles, no search)
/search        → Search page (10 profiles, full search UI)
/profile/:id   → Detail page (current)

Alternative: Combined Approach

If you want a more seamless experience, you could have:

    Default catalogue view at / (no search visible, 20 profiles)
    Search mode toggle - clicking search icon transforms page into search mode (10 results, filters appear)
    This keeps users on one page but changes the UI dramatically

Would you like me to implement the two separate pages, or would you prefer the combined approach? If separate pages, should the catalogue page have any navigation to the search page?

---
# user

yes

---
# figma-make

I'll implement two separate pages with distinct purposes. Let me create a catalogue page and a dedicated search page.

I've implemented two distinct pages with clear differentiation:

Browse Page (/) - Discovery & Exploration

    Shows all 20 profiles in a spacious 4-column grid
    Features role-based filter pills and sorting (by name, age, company)
    Clean header with profile count and a button to navigate to search
    No search input - keeps focus on browsing
    Perfect for casual exploration

Search Page (/search) - Targeted Finding

    Displays 10 profiles maximum with real-time search
    Prominent search bar with autoclear button
    Highlights matched text in yellow/purple
    Toggle between compact list view (2 columns with job/company visible) and grid view (3 columns)
    Shows result count and "no results" empty state
    More functional, tool-like interface

The key differentiators are the layout density, presence of search functionality, and the overall purpose - browse for discovery vs. search for finding specific people.

# user

redesign the welcome page, i want to display few profiles. I don't want any filters, just a nice welcome message with few profiles. I'm thinking also about infinite load or add more button to it, which will generate more random profiles

---
# figma-make

Perfect! I've redesigned the welcome page with a beautiful hero section featuring a welcoming message, "Meet Amazing People," along with a call-to-action to search profiles. The page now displays 8 random profiles initially and includes a "Load More Profiles" button that adds 8 more each time it's clicked. The profiles are shuffled randomly on page load, and when all profiles are viewed, users see a friendly message suggesting they try the search feature instead. All filters and sorting have been removed for a clean, welcoming experience.

---
# user
what other features i can add to search page to make it stand out even more?

---
#figma-make

Great question! Here are some standout features that would really elevate the search page:
High-Impact Features
1. Advanced Filters Sidebar

    Age range slider (e.g., 25-35)
    Multi-select company filter with checkboxes
    Location filter (if you add city/country to profile data)
    Experience level (Junior, Mid, Senior based on age/title)
    Active filters badge count + "Clear all" button
    Collapsible filter sections

2. Recent Searches

    Show last 5 searches as clickable chips below search bar
    "Clear history" option
    Persists in localStorage

3. Search Suggestions/Autocomplete

        Matching names
        Popular companies
        Job titles
        "Press Enter to search for..."
    Keyboard navigation (↑↓ arrows)

4. Smart Sort Options

    Sort by relevance (how well they match query)
    Name A-Z / Z-A
    Age (youngest/oldest first)
    Recently added (if you add timestamps)

5. Saved/Favorite Profiles

    Heart icon on cards to save favorites
    "Saved Profiles" filter toggle
    Persists in localStorage
    Count badge (e.g., "5 saved")

6. Keyboard Shortcuts

    / to focus search input
    ESC to clear search
    Arrow keys to navigate results
    Enter to open highlighted profile
    Show shortcuts hint at bottom

7. Search Operators (Power User Feature)

    Side-by-side comparison view showing all fields

9. Export Results

    "Export as CSV" button
    Download filtered results
    Copy results to clipboard

10. Field-Specific Search Toggle

    Pills to search only in: Name Bio Job Title Company All
    Multiple selections possible

11. Search Stats/Insights

    "Most searched profiles this week"
    "Trending companies"
    "Popular roles"
    Shows in empty state or sidebar

12. Save Search Query

    "Save this search" button
    Name your saved searches
    Quick access to run saved searches again

My Top 5 Recommendations

If I were to implement the most impactful features:

    Advanced Filters Sidebar (age, company, clear all) - Makes search much more powerful
    Recent Searches - Huge UX improvement, easy to implement
    Saved/Favorite Profiles - Adds personal value, encourages return visits
    Keyboard Shortcuts - Makes power users love it
    Bulk Compare Mode - Unique feature that's really useful

Would you like me to implement any of these? I'd suggest starting with the filters sidebar + recent searches + favorites as they work really well together!

write a prompt describing the welcome screen using tailwind. Use the css grid layout that is readable by other ai. We don't need to change the profile cards so only focus on elements above profile cards

# user
remove the grid change functionality. WDYT about makeing the back button on the left to keep it in line with details page.  Profiles should use the "list" card type in two rows

---
# figma-make

Perfect! I've updated the search page with your suggestions:

    Removed grid/list toggle - Simplified the UI by removing the view mode switcher
    Back button on the left - Moved to align with the detail page pattern using ArrowLeft icon with "Back to Browse" text
    List card layout only - All profiles now display in the horizontal list card format (avatar on left, content on right) in a 2-column grid

This creates better consistency across pages and a cleaner, more focused search experience. The back button placement makes navigation more intuitive since it matches the pattern users see on detail pages.
