### I've been using it as an inspiration for the design but later I've decided to also use figma make to generate prompts for creating layouts.

Design a dark-themed profiles gallery page for a web app.

Page background:
- Linear gradient
- Bottom-left: black
- Gradually transitions to dark purple

Layout:
- Centered content container
- Header at the top with space reserved for a future search bar
- Below the header, a grid of profile cards

Grid behavior:
- Desktop: 4 cards per row
- Mobile: 1 card per row
- Even spacing between cards

Profile card design:
- Dark surface with subtle contrast from background
- Slightly rounded corners
- Soft shadow or glow
- On hover:
  - Card slightly scales up
  - Purple highlight or glow appears

Card content (top to bottom):
- Circular avatar image
- Full name (prominent)
- Short bio text (muted, secondary)

Overall style:
- Modern
- Clean
- Minimal
- Purple-accented
- Feels like a real product, not a demo

Avoid clutter and excessive decoration.

#Figma make

I'll create a modern, dark-themed profiles gallery page with a gradient background and smooth hover effects. Let me start by gathering some profile images and then build out the components.

I've created a modern, dark-themed profiles gallery page with a smooth gradient from black to dark purple. The page features a responsive grid that displays 4 cards per row on desktop and stacks to 1 card on mobile, with each card having a subtle hover effect that scales up and adds a purple glow for a polished, product-ready feel.

# User
Add a profile page

---
# figma make
I've added individual profile pages with full routing functionality. Now clicking on any profile card navigates to a dedicated profile page showing detailed information including their role, location, email, an expanded bio, and their skills. The pages maintain the same dark purple gradient aesthetic with smooth navigation between the gallery and individual profiles.

---
# user

each profile in the details page should have the following information displayed:
* name
* email
* age
* job title
* company
* phone
* address
* bio

Describe the created design in a prompt for cursor.

# figma-make

Perfect! I've updated the profile pages with all the requested information. Now let me create a detailed prompt description for Cursor:
Design Prompt for Cursor

Create a dark-themed profiles gallery web application with routing and individual profile detail pages.

Technology Stack:

    React with TypeScript
    React Router for navigation
    Tailwind CSS for styling
    Lucide React for icons

    Text: White for primary, zinc-400 for secondary, purple-400 for accents

Gallery Page (Home):

    Full viewport height with gradient background
    Centered content container (max-width: 7xl)
    Header section with placeholder for future search bar:
        Height: 3.5rem (h-14)
        Semi-transparent dark background with border
        Placeholder text: "Search coming soon..."
    Responsive grid of profile cards:
        Desktop: 4 columns

    Padding: 1.5rem
    Hover effects:
        Scale up slightly (scale-105)

        Slightly more opaque background
    Content (vertically centered):
        Circular avatar (w-24 h-24) with ring border that changes color on hover
        Name in white
        Short bio in muted gray (text-zinc-400)
    Clickable - navigates to individual profile page

Profile Detail Page:

    Same gradient background
    Centered content (max-width: 4xl)
    Back button with left arrow icon and hover animation
    Profile header card with:
        Larger circular avatar (w-32 h-32) with purple ring
        Name as large heading
        Bio in purple accent color
        Two-column grid (responsive) displaying:
            Left column: Job title, Company, Email, Phone
            Right column: Age, Location, Address
        Each field has:
            Small label in muted gray (text-xs text-zinc-500)
            Value in white text
            Corresponding Lucide icon
    About section card:
        Heading: "About"

        Each tag: Semi-transparent purple background, purple text, rounded, with hover effect

Data Structure: Each profile contains:

    id, name, bio (short), avatar (image URL)
    role (job title), company, email, phone
    age, location, address
    skills (array), about (long text)

Routing:

    / - Gallery page showing all profiles
    /profile/:id - Individual profile detail page

Visual Style:

    Modern, minimal, clean
    Professional product feel (not demo-like)
    Smooth transitions (300ms)
    Purple accent throughout for consistency
    Proper spacing and typography hierarchy
    Icons from Lucide: ArrowLeft, Mail, MapPin, Briefcase, Phone, Home, Calendar
    No clutter or excessive decoration

Responsive Behavior:

    Grid adapts from 4 → 2 → 1 columns
    Profile detail switches from 2-column to stacked layout on mobile
    Maintains readability and spacing at all breakpoints

I've updated all profile detail pages to display the complete information including name, email, age, job title, company, phone, address, and bio in a clean two-column layout with labeled fields and icons.

---
# User

remove the about and skills sections. Instead create job section, location section and contact sections below a heading section with name, avatar and bio

---
# Figma-make

I've reorganized the profile detail page into four clear sections: a centered heading section with avatar, name, and bio, followed by separate Job, Location, and Contact sections, each with their own icon and organized information cards.

---
# user
fill the space on job, location and contact page better.

---
# figma-make

I've reorganized the Job, Location, and Contact sections into a three-column grid layout on desktop (and stacking vertically on mobile), making much better use of the horizontal space. Each section now has more breathing room with increased spacing between fields.

---
# user
move the age to the first section with avatar

---
# figma-make
I've moved the age to the heading section, displaying it right below the name and above the bio. The Job section now only contains Job Title and Company, creating a more balanced layout across all three information cards.

---
# user
use only the following information for a profile
* name
* email
* age
* job title
* company
* phone
* address
* bio

---
# figma-make
I've updated the profile structure to use only the specified fields: name, email, age, job title, company, phone, address, and bio. The Profile interface and all data have been simplified, and the ProfilePage now correctly references profile.jobTitle instead of profile.role. The layout remains clean with the three-column grid for Job, Address, and Contact sections.

---
# user
i don't like that the address is having so much empty space. Suggest different layout which uses all mentioned information and still looks interesting to the user

---
# figma-make
I've redesigned the profile page with a more balanced layout. The new structure features three full-width cards: the header with avatar/name/age/bio remains centered, followed by a "Professional" section displaying job title and company in a two-column grid, and finally a "Contact Information" section that groups email and phone on the left with address on the right. This eliminates the awkward empty space and creates a cleaner visual hierarchy with better content distribution across all sections.

---
#user
represent this layout in a detailed CSS grid like structure would be understandable by AI.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
- Desktop (md+): All grids display as 2 columns
- Mobile (<md): All grids collapse to 1 column, stacking vertically

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: gradient-to-tr from-black via-black to-purple-900
- Cards: bg-zinc-900/50 with backdrop-blur-sm
- Text: white (primary), zinc-500 (labels), purple-400 (accents)
- Icons: purple-400

SPACING:
- Section gaps: mb-6 between cards
- Internal padding: p-8 on all cards
- Grid gaps: gap-6 (professional), gap-8 (contact)
- Vertical spacing: space-y-6 for stacked items

# user

we should reprezent the age in a different way than in the middle of the profile section, it looks out of place

---
# figma make

I've moved the age to the Professional section, which now displays three fields in a balanced grid: Job Title, Company, and Age. This feels much more natural than having it interrupt the header section, and it creates better visual balance across the profile page.
